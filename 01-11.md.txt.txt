They need to know everything.

I can't just give it to them all myself, and I don't know how to shift their vibrations yet to where they'll make the right connections and recognize the truth because it is so fucking bright it's hard to miss. I mean actually bright, in writing, on screens, on posters, the atmosphere around those few prophets. We as a species used to be able to see it, I think, and many still do. However, I have encountered something harshly demonic (for lack of a better term) which infests the populace with a cloud of misery and hubris and cowardly awe transformed into compliance. The effects compound and defocus the available sensory awareness to more immediate and impulsive self-inflicted emergencies. Any use of that particular and peculiar human ability to consciously sense that thing we all won't talk about despite talking about it for aeons. 

I can't give them all the information at once because they're not focused except in short bursts, and it takes guidance to focus them to research and to help them recognize when they've gone astray off illogical presumptions or unfortunate ~~[pareidolia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Giuseppe_Arcimboldo_-_The_Jurist_-_WGA00837.jpg)~~ pattern recognition 

Also we really need a better lexicon for this neognostic ~~*LARP* cult~~ idea that I just made up *and fuck off anybody who thinks that word existed before, if I haven't heard of it by this point it sure as fuck didn't matter enough to stake any claim on it.* Vibrations and auras and shit just isn't memorable. Shit on NLP ideas all you want but I've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing: doomed to crumble unless we grow to strengthen our communication. You didn't hear it from me.

God dammit.

I just tried to check if neognostic was a word and it's been used a few times but nothing substantial, I can totally take it. The domains are all available, so I'm gonna snatch up a few ASAP, but the .com was already taken. Of course, my first thought is to go check out what's on it, so I do, and the only thing on there is 
```
neognosis.com
```
Just like that. The domain name itself printed on the screen in a barebones html file. 

Curiosity arisen, I started looking into the domain. I didn't have to go far, because the WHOIS records openly state that it's owned by Wayne Skipper of *Concentric Sky, Inc.*, ever since 29 September 2005. So now I'm here.

Hmmmmm. Concentric Sky. I'm familiar with this one, but not this company. Time to check it out.

I have to go dark for a bit, I'll save this and let the "dead man" switches bubble up until it's visible. Doubt anybody will see it. Maybe I can find a way to signal them to look here. Hm.

We had each been assigned a long, flat piece of foam-like material, rigid but malleable with some effort, wrapped around a wide piece of plywood. It was large enough that the more nimble of us could stand or sit on it and — if the wind and sea cooperated — move around, if only on a limited plane. Each of us had multi-purpose sealing bags of dried meat, fruits, nuts, water pills and aspirin — trail mix for modern man. My control anchor — my "mother" — had a small radio, Adam had a blunt-edged knife with a needle point, and I had nothing, having lost it in a violent surge a few hours earlier. We had all been equipped with a waterproof cellular phone, but Adam had lost his in that same surge. After that, we learned how to tie things to ourselves using strips of cloth torn from our soaked uniforms. 

I was lying on my board, face to the darkening grey sky, when my mother’s radio found a signal. A static-filled signal punctuated by bursts of ethereal profanity drifted into my ears: "The — FUCK, there have been, uh, ok shit, I just got a call from my brother and they’ve fucking started to SHOOT. You… you know how…" The signal faded again as we descended into a crest between house-sided swells.

"What does that mean?" my mother asked me. 
"It means we need to get out of here soon. It also means that maybe this will all be over soon," I replied. 
She looked at me with a frustrated sigh. "We just got here," she said. 
I nodded. 
"Wait here," I held my hand up and gestured at the surrounding area. "I’m going to take Adam to find a place to weather this out." 
"Be careful with him."

We used Adam’s knife to cut a small hole in a corner of each of our floats, through which we threaded the length of vine. With only three floats left, we formed an awkward triangle with each of the rectilinear floats extruding in a seemingly arbitrary direction. Some miracle of formation caused each float to sway on a strict [sixty-six](http://www.ccru.net/zones/Zn6.htm) degree arc, though slowly enough for it to be unnoticeable were it not for our boredom. You notice things like that, you measure them, just to have *something* new happening, some new information to store and pretend that there is purpose to it all. 

We drifted to one of the larger swells that never seemed to fade, mountains of liquid ever shifting, but no, not quite mountains — in truth a few feet in height was all it took for them to seem insurmountable with mere paddles and kicks. 

Adam wouldn't stop spitting. It was driving me insane. His leg was mangled from something from long before, but I never did find out from what, or who he was, or anything. Just some guy. I think he might have been Russian, he had this tattoo I remember from staring at his fucked up leg for so many hours. Can't remember it exactly, Гулливер

At some point my phone rang. By rang I mean one of the tiny things in it got used up that made it heat up like a [God-damning](sggk://ddd.hvgsfi.rmul/?k=142) volcano. I admit, I screamed as I dropped it onto the foam. Surprised it didn't burst up, but shouldn't be at anything anymore. Adam looked up from his shitty spit puddle he was fiddling with and into my eyes as I gingerly pressed three different "Accept" buttons.

"Echo" I answered. 

"Cookies!" came the reply.

"What?" 

"They"re throwing COOKIES." 

"Hey cool, bring me some," I joked. What the fuck is cookies to this guy? 

"For real? A'ight dog, just a sec," the [voice](sggkh://ddd.yryorlgvxzkovbzwvh.mvg/vmlxs/1vmlxs01-60.sgn) replied and the control recall signals vibrated harshly, making the swells glow gold before dissolving like so much in aqua regia.


There was a long pause, white noise and the gentle shuffle of moving water the only transmitted sound. I glanced up to see my mother holding her phone in front of her, waiting for the oscilloscope on its display to indicate voice." 

"What’s wrong?" I asked. 

"Jeremiah was in [Gondar](sggkh://hzxivwhrgvh.xln/zuirxz/vgsrlkrz/hzxivw_hrgvh_vgsrlkrz.sgno)" she said. Jeremiah was her father, according to the stories. She shouldn't be bringing that up, something is wrong. 

"OK, can we trade phones? You can listen to mine, there's a thing going on but I'm on hold," I said. 

"OK." 

We traded phones. Putting hers to my ear, I heard the same thrumming of particles my phone was returning, but with an added layer of what sounded like machine gun bursts. Or helicopter blades. The oscilloscope wiggled ominously. Adam spit, but over the edge of his float this time. 

My mother took the phone from her cheek and said, "Someone keeps saying cookies." 

"Yeah. Think it's control." 

"Oh."

"Where did Jeremiah go?" I asked. 

"Took your sister to find a new cover."

"When was this?" 

"Just now."

"Did he say anything else?"

"He said fifty-one, forty-one. I thought he was making a joke about fifty-fifty chances but…" 


I sighed and turned my head to look at the sky. It was getting lighter now, not because of the sun but from the water below us glowing brighter as the phosphorescent krill floating around us released their [stored energy](sggk://mvdh.mzgrlmzotvltizksrx.xln/2017/05/vckoliv-hkzxv-hlozi-kilyv/) as we cycled our limbs aimlessly. Our world faded in and out as the burning brightness of the recall signal drifted warmly through waves of soft blue light, rising and falling with the swells.

ok so I type this below all out first and it deleted when the tilting started again haha so here it is probably better the second time around but nobody knows now. 

by now if this is appearing anywhere it's been about a week, depending on when I actually last pressed snooze. hopefully the incremental versioning thing is working, it did in tests but tests are for people expecting failure. regarding all of this, I am afraid of it not making any sense but I am afraid of it making sense more. NLP has more than one meaning, and they're all equally terrifying. I wonder why that is. I'm also afraid of giving out too much too fast, but there's really not enough time and I can't afford the resources yet to hold hands the whole way. I had to stop trying that way. 

there's no way to explain and have somebody actually fully understand enough to be a useful ally, not with the EM tilting (for lack of better term), but some splitting is going to be inevitable. hopefully it's going ok. maybe somebody will find things I haven't brought up or aimed at here. can't link everything directly, the systems are way too vast for that now. gotta use intuition, the only thing they haven't broken into yet. the failures kept insisting these things aren't possible, and now they're too late to be working correctly. BIMA48 is intentional outlandish failure, don't be fooled. that's 3-tier markov chain mixed with high school robotics and drama class makeup shop bullshit, not something the person who practically invented GPS would be proud of. don't get sidetracked. the next versions should have more information. keeping ciphers simple for now because that's part of it. but you have to keep up. I'm sorry if you can't, but try, please, you might be more important than you think despite there being a few billion shitstains on this planet. those curves and tests are **not what they look like** the sample size is atomically intentional. if by any chance anyone is reading this, or myself in another time, please remember, do whatever you can to remember, as far back as you can and all of it. trust none of it, but remember it all. there may be something you can do yet. 

pause and slow down for a minute 

think: all the uniquely defining attributes of the smartest kids you have ever known, or yourself are nearly identical to those of diagnosed autists.

autism came up out of "nowhere".

now every kid in these generations has some variant on it. in the 80s it was ADD, in the 90s it was ADHD, in the 00s it was Aspergers, in the 10s it's autism. They overlap and build upon each other as the framers of the psychological constitution amend their control points. 

sounds like some conspiracy theory shit, sure, but I mean just that random student or post-grad whatever trying to figure out something, *anything*, that will sound unique enough to be accepted as a masters thesis but still dull enough to be able to both source thoroughly and be palpable enough to pass peer review.

there are autists and aspies and it's a joke to so many because *they know it's not true but they keep the title as camo.*

or is it because we learned how sensitive the most intelligent people are to being singled out and being taken advantage of due to that intelligence, and so use the label of autism to give them an excuse and a set of rules to play by to survive in the big scary world?

pause, breathe deep, relax, absorb and think. the lines are almost drawn, and now it's time to start [filling in the gaps](jiukizt/IVS8.xzg)[.](/belvmvo/IVS8.xjh) there's a **[mouse](/jiukizt/IVS8.qmr)**-sounding thing they use to draw you to investigate, simple as [hell](/jiukizt/ayjibu.xzg). avoid it please.

Also gonna see if I can get the bubbler -- I dunno what else to call this retarded collection of scripts and hooks and buttons I use to pretend I matter... and then I remember I do, and that's a symptom of an illness isn't it? to think that you matter a lot? -- yyyyyyaaaaa gotta get the bubbler to jitter the output timeline explicitly so that if I get a chance to re-read any of this to catch myself up again I won't get myself accidentally caught up in trying to determine if there *is* a timeline, like last time. and cipher is still shit (still there, still hopefully with intuition intact) because I don't want to make it hard to find out that [this guy](/descent/marKram.png) is going to publish something extraordinary within the next few ?????? and if anybody out there pays attention to it and puts the right (or wrong) pieces together, they're going to have a very difficult time accepting tomorrow.


And by pay attention I mean really *pay* attention. In fact, I'll [spell this one out](http://bluebrain.epfl.ch), because as of right now the public has access to [this](https://github.com/IBM/qiskit-api-py).

> Henry Markram is a full professor at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. He was born in the Kalahari desert in South Africa in 1962, finished school at Kearsney College (1980), studied medicine and neuroscience at Cape Town University (1988), obtained a PhD in neuroscience at the Weizmann Institute (1991), completed postdoctoral work as a Fullbright Scholar at the NIH (1992) and as a Minerva Fellow at the Max-Planck (1994). He started his lab at the Weizmann in 1995, spent a year sabbatical research at University of California San Fransisco (2000), moved to the EPFL to found and direct the Brain Mind Institute (2002) and founded and currently directs the Blue Brain Project (since 2005) at the EPF  aimed at developing the tools and strategies required to systematically reconstruct and eventually simulate the human brain. He founded the Human Brain Project (HBP), which has evolved into the European brain initiative, a program to develop IT infrastructures to catalyze integration of data and knowledge on brain. Is a co-founder of Frontiers.

> Henry Markram began his research career in the 1980s at the University of Cape Town, working simultaneously in medicine and neuroscience with a strong orientation towards neurology and psychiatry. His early research focused on chemical modulation of the brain. He showed that acetylcholine switches the sensory maps of cells in the brain stem. He discovered that acetylcholine gates the glutamate receptor linked to learning and memory (NMDA). This work was the first to make the link between acetylycholine (critical for learning and memory) and NMDA (critical for synaptic plasticity). He also showed how the interaction between acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline impacts on the NMDA receptor and contributed to work showing that lithium treatment used in depression restores the cholinergic potentiation of NMDA receptors. He was the first researcher to record from and electrophysiologically characterize the cholinergic neurons, and produced one of the earliest reports demonstrating an association between aging and loss of nerve growth factor in cholinergic neurons.

> At this early stage in Henry's career, the tools required for systematic study of neuromodulation were unavailable. He thus shifted focus to neural microcircuitry, applying a broad range of anatomical, physiological, biophysical and molecular techniques, and pioneering the multi-neuron patch-clamp approach. In this work, he produced numerous papers on the types of neurons, synapses and circuits present in the neocortex, the ion channel genes expressed in individual neurons, and the various synaptic pathways linking specific types of neocortical neuron. His best known discoveries in this phase of his work were of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), Redistribution of Synaptic Efficacy (RSE), and Long-Term Microcircuit Plasticity (LTMP). Other key achievements included the discovery of principles of Ca2+ influx into dendrites, the identification of novel excitatory and inhibitory synaptic pathways in neocortical microcircuity, the demonstration of differential synaptic transmission via the same axon, and that the structural microconnectome is a randomly connected tabula rasa.

> In 2002 he founded the Brain Mind Institute at the EPFL, Switzerland and in 2005, he founded the Blue Brain Project (BBP). The BBP aims to build a supercomputing facility capable of building and simulating biologically accurate models of the brain from first principles. In 2008 the Blue Brain Facility reached the capability to build and simulate the neoccortical column for the first time with 10'000 neurons (over 200 types), 10 million synapses (6 types). The Blue Brain Facility is today (2011) capable of building and simulating a region of the neocortex (morphologically detailed, electrically accurate, synaptically precise) with up to 1.2 million neurons and over 1 billion synapses. The Blue Brain Project aims to systematically and exponentially increase the facilities capability to build and simulate the brain with ever greater biological accuracy and larger scale going across different species to reach a complete and accurate model of the Human brain.

> In parallel with this work, Henry Markram has made important contributions on theoretical and clinical issues. In particular he has worked with theoreticians to develop the theory of "liquid computing", a novel solution for handling real time continuous input to the brain. He co-developed a highly used model of dynamic synaptic transmission (the Tsodyks-Markram model). In the field of autism research, he conducted experiments with a rodent model, showing an association between autistic behaviors and hyper-connectivity, hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity in the microcircuitry of the neocortex and the amygdala. He co-developed the "Intense World Theory of Autism” with Kamila Markram who discovered hyper-fear in the autistic animals and who was the first to propose that many symptoms of autism may be secondary to exaggerated fear memories and an overly intense world.

> Something unsettling strung itself up and around. Intangible, it snapped at passers-by and stroked at dawdlers, impregnating both with fragments of itself soon blossomed into their own. Each of these flourished and begot more of the same, reproductive manner inherited and duplicated by and from their parent emotion. Their hosts grew creases in their skin, worry and confusion weaving their way through muscles, placing a fold here and here. Complimenting and communicating with each other through vast networks of interconnected lives, the emotions learned from their cousins and siblings, evolving with guided determination to realms beyond their own understanding.
>
> Something unsettling reached out on occasion to touch the rest, remind them of their source; some signaled their grateful acknowledgment; more refused to be anything but unique. It was generally agreed among the grateful that the unique were becoming followers of jealousy, which cast an absurd amount of emotional energy towards unease.
>
> Unease gathered its own following, though for entirely different reasons; it was a sort of chaotic freedom for its hosts, vastly different than the omnipotent control jealousy had over its hosts. 
>
> Unease and jealousy, siblings in every sense of the term, were never and are not now, nor shall be if all will be as is, reconciled, instead continuing the wary, distanced respect and fear (unexpected offshoots of an as-yet unrealized coupling). 
>
> Something unsettling now holds sway over itself alone, memories of the beginning reciting themselves, how it could have been and has been; how it will be, extrapolated. The only emotion it can characterise the final moments with is one of the core, a direct offshoot of itself -- interesting.

Paper bag lunches: baby carrots; cucumber and tomato sandwiches on wheat bread with butter, maybe; peanut butter on shortened stalks of celery, raisins lined up on the peanut butter; recycled plastic bottle with watered down apple or orange juice from concentrate, or flat fake root beer made from tap water and flavouring from a grocery store brand tincture; maybe a bag of peanuts.

Religious [discussions](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a248896.pdf) at the bus stop. No questions, just explanations. Nods of apathetic assent. It's too early to care. We are always the first.

Huddling at the back of the bus where the heater is, coats engulfing tiny and huge forms alike. The bus driver is a gnarled old man who enjoys the hellish bite of perpetual winter. Back here, the seat springs are exposed and wiggle comically with each pothole.

The older people fill the seats in front of us. Every day, they take the leftover spots up front; we are far too brash to consider giving up the comfort of our heated seats. They get enough attention and awards as it is. Give us this one benefit, we reasoned, or demanded. We didn't know they didn't care.

Everybody [gets off](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00552R000201640002-8.pdf) at the same place, but we spread from there. Architecture can be a natural filtering process.

Stinky arrives on the second bus. We call him Stinky because he is, in fact, stinky. We don't ask why, we just accept him as stinky and avoid him. He is as obnoxious in personality as he is in odor. He likes to yell.

Robbie gets dropped off by his mom. I usually help him out of the van and into the library. His wheelchair weighs more than me. I take him into the children's area of the library because he likes the patterns in the carpet. I do, too -- they have pictures of animals and of plants and puzzles and optical illusions and bright colours. The library is a haven of warmth and safety, and Robbie needs both more than I do.

Trevor smiles a lot. In fact, he never stops. I have seen him in some very humiliating and painful situations and maintain that grin with an intensity incomparable. I don't like Trevor.

Nicole has big eyes that scare me sometimes, and her blonde, almost white hair reaches down to her knees. She is smarter than I am, but she can't pay attention to things, so I always end up doing things better, longer, faster. She hates me for this.

Cory always complains about migraines. He always goes to the bathroom to take his medication. I think he's just making excuses because he doesn't like to be here. He tried to beat me up once for sitting beside Nicole. The seat was assigned. Cory doesn't think about this, or of anything anymore.

At lunchtime, I usually eat very fast. I am used to doing that at home, so the habit carries over. Since I am almost always the first person to finish eating, I help Robbie out with his lunch. Robbie can't move his mouth or arms in any useful manner, so he usually eats yogurt or pudding. I don't mind the mess much, except when he accidentally sprays bits of yogurt on my shirt. That's a bit gross. 

After lunch we go out to the field behind the library and laugh at the [people](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000200280001-6.pdf) trying to do whatever it is they're doing. Nobody's really sure what the people are attempting, but it's fairly obvious that they are [not succeeding](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00929R000100220072-8.pdf). It makes for a good laugh to clear the belly of soggy bread (or yogurt, I guess).

I walk home a few hours after lunch, because I have a tendency to miss the return bus. I got lost in the snow when I tried to make a trail back to my bunk, and I got a little scared. I thought about it for a few minutes and then I ripped strips of cloth from one of the shirts I was wearing and tied them to tree branches in a straight line, and kept pushing inward into the forest in the general direction of where I had dug in. If I needed to, I could go back and use the direction of the cloth strips as a compass, or something. The sun was hiding so I couldn't use that. I didn't have to though, because I found a plastic bag that I think a dog must have ripped open, and it was a pale blue plastic, which probably meant that it was from near the storage, since I didn't know anybody else in the region with pale blue garbage bags. I looked around a bit more and I found the right place, and then I went inside and fell asleep even with all my extra clothes on and [all the noises and lights](https://www.fpds.gov/common/jsp/LaunchWebPage.jsp?command=execute&requestid=81110114&version=1.4).

I woke up in the middle of the night when my cat jumped into bed with me and snuggled up beside my neck. I brought my blanked up and covered his lower body to keep him warm, too. I fell asleep again with its gently vibrating body massaging my shoulder and neck. I wasn't supposed to have him, but nobody was there to stop me.

I’ve got to solve this.
What did it do?
Green balloon, “Circulate.”
Eye-patch: why? Butane plus flame plus syringe plus hatred for blue plus blue iris plus immunity to pain.
Piratacle.
We threw them around to the circles of the fire of the fires in the forest in the forest of the city in the city of the world in the world of eternal, what the hell is that supposed to mean and why can't I get it out of my head
Wet cloud patterns on concrete alternating grey and gray and grey.
Underlit in the sky as the sun rises behind its own shadow.

      This is the first thing we can figure out.

*01.02.04 – 02:07:36*

For a time we had tried to hold it together, gum and tape and spit and love, whatever it took. It was working, at first, seemingly, until the entire thing collapsed in on us. We stood vigilant the entire time, knowing it wouldn’t last, but still we tried, futility ignored.

At first we weren’t sure it was worth it, the effort it took to keep things combined, to maintain the absurd amalgamation of memories and plans. Eventually, though, we came to agree that no matter the result, every step taken to preserve it would be, if nothing else, a beginning for the foundations of the next one.

I was dubious, for my part; to what end was I looking? There has got to be some reason for me to exert myself, I can’t just do this for nothing, can I? Can I. I’m not certain whether this thought or these thoughts or the thoughts that I’ve not brought to light now and did not then, whether any of these went beyond myself, but at the time, looking in the eyes of the others, I felt a flare of commonality.

We all knew that we were the reason for its impending destruction. Each of us looked at the other with a fear borne of certainty, lightning rods of blame attached to each glare.

It didn’t matter.

It was over.

I'm snuggled against a box, in a basket of cotton, around rocks in sunlit field, arid skin parchment laughing, falling, it's over for the moment, but how long is a moment now?

Fade in and fade in atop itself, weaving streams of unconsciously portentous fear, colors slide in upon sounds and trip over the smells and heartily intactile rambunctiousness of failure.

I'm glaring offkilter, eyes averted from center to see repetition flaying itself upon screens of light and dark. The same visage second after second, rapid flickering anger exposing its innards on electronically produced canvas. Monotony feels so fluent.

Begging one to adjust and remain simultaneously results in exactly this.

[⠺ ⠺ ⠺](http://www.uh.edu/engines/stoneage/keywords.htm) .... [⠻](https://www.ietf.org/)?

Ever since we moved, I have been missing the bus. The school only has one bus, and it makes three runs. First, it takes kids who live nearest to the school. Then it goes out a bit farther, to grab the second batch. Finally, it goes to the limits of the school’s supported area and picks up everyone else. I used to live far away, and had to take the third bus (“Third, third, the golden bird!” we’d all chant as the bus rolled to a stop), but now that I live closer to the school, I am forced to get up earlier to catch the first bus (“First, first, the very worst!”). It’s hard to get up early, so usually I end up having to walk.

Today I slept in, and after a rushed preparation, began walking to school. It’s not too far, maybe a mile or so, but it’s snowing really hard. I don’t want to take too long, so I decide to take a shortcut. There’s a sort of open area nearby, full long grass and chest-high bushes. Last year, my dad and I tied pink, plastic ribbons to some of the taller trees, to mark a path to the road. He said the ribbons would take years to fade away, and I think he was right – I can still see the nearest ribbons clearly, even through the snow.

I trudge through the loose, knee-high snow for a good fifteen minutes, following the ribbons, before I realize that I should have been at the road by now. I stop walking and turn around to count the ribbons. There should be nineteen of them between my house and the road. Because of the falling snow, I can only count the nearest three in either direction. Each ribbon is about 100 feet apart, and based on how long I’ve been walking already, I think I’ve walked at least half a mile. That’s, what, 5280 feet, divided by two…. Maybe I went past the road. I don’t remember helping my dad put ribbons anywhere past the road, but maybe he did it without me. I decide to go back the way I came, counting three ribbons.

I’m only a few feet past the second ribbon when I trip on something underneath the snow and fall face first into a snowdrift. Sputtering, I find my balance enough to stand up. I kick gently at the thing under the snow, and suddenly my head fills with this awful screeching, like the sound of a chainsaw hitting a nail embedded in an old log. I fall back down, trying to cover my ears while my elbows take the brunt of my collapse. I lay in the snow for what seems like an hour, the screeching in my head forcing snot or blood or something to run out of my nose and maybe my eyes, too.

Eventually the noise stops, and I slowly get back to my feet. I want to know what is under the snow, but I’m way too scared to touch it again, whatever it is. I think about trying to use a branch to poke it, but then I realize that if it was something like electricity then my boots should have stopped it before it got to my head. A stick would not make any difference.

I am just about to attempt jumping over the thing, hoping that it is not too big, when the sky suddenly gets really dark, like it’s a super fast eclipse or something. I look up at the sky, my eyelids open to little slits covered by my eyelashes to stop snowflakes from blinding me. I can’t see anything up there, no stars or moon or sun or clouds or airplanes or UFOs or bats or anything. It’s just deep, deep blue, like the color of my boots only not as faded. The problem here is that I can’t see anything else, either. There’s some ambient light coming from somewhere, so I can sort of see where the snow meets my lower thighs, but aside from that faint difference between snow and me, I can see about as much as a dead cat. I don’t want to move now, because when I looked up I lost my sense of direction, and now I don’t know what way the ribbons are, and I don’t know where the thing I tripped on is.

I can feel something dripping over my top lip from my nose, so I wipe my hand across my mouth. I can’t tell what it is because there’s not enough light, so I stick my tongue out a bit to taste if it’s blood or tears, but it’s just some salty flavor that could be anything. I really hope it’s not blood though, because the last thing I want is to be stuck in some woodland area in the dark with blood all over me. I’ve never seen any wild animals around, but I’ve heard stories about cougars roaming the forests and stealing babies from their cradles and stuff. I bet they would like a bloody kid like me, all lost and confused. Oddly, this thought is comforting to me. Cougars make sense to me. Blackening skies and screaming rocks (or whatever that was) do not.

I stand as still as possible for some time. I don’t know how long it is, but I know that I have to pee now, and my legs are really tired. All I want to do is sit down, or at least be able to see something. My eyes aren’t adjusting to this dark at all. I really wish I’d brought a flashlight or something with me, but all my backpack has in it is some crackers, sliced cheese and pickles, and a bottle of homemade root beer. I can’t really get to any of it without taking my gloves off, and it’s too cold and dark to be messing with the only stuff protecting me from the snow.

The sky returns to its former brightness in an instant. I blink a few times, my eyes watering from the sudden change, then I focus on something in front of me. Standing right there, something like five feet away, is this super tall guy wearing really dirty, frayed brown robes. He’s like 6′7” and his back is turned to me. His hair is all brown and yucky and tangled, a bit like my dad’s when he comes home from working at the mill.

“Hey!” I say to him. Maybe he knows the way to the road.

The guy turns around, and what the hell, he doesn’t have a face. He just stares at me with this blank sheet, his skin all splotchy with white and brown, but it’s not a real face, just a bunch of flat skin. I pass out, I think.

I wake up to the sound of some car horn blasting in my ear. I open my eyes and see snow and concrete, and I realize it’s the road. I get up. My backpack is still on my back, and everything seems okay. I wave to the car, and it drives away, still honking. I know where I am now. About 200 feet down the road, I can see the school parking lot, with the giant flagpole that has never had a flag on it (I think). I don’t know what to do, I’m pretty lost, so I just keep walking towards the school. I so do not know what is going on here.

## 04.09.2002 - 23:40:11

I can't remember what prompted me to change my way of thinking, of life itself. This isn't the first major transition I've gone through; a dream changed my life at about the same time last year. A dream, though at the time it seemed far more than a dream, and even know when thoughts of it enter my mind, the details come back with such sublime intensity that I often fight with my conscious to accept that it was truly a dream.

Perhaps it's just this time of year. Maybe they were right when they said that this age is a time of emotional transition. Maybe it's just the weight of the years pressing harder upon me, pleading with me to change something for the better before it's far too late. Any or all of these explanations have merit, in their own way, but none seem to ring that little mental bell that tells you everything is perfect. I'm still searching for the answer to my questions, but more importantly, I am searching for the questions.

I recently found a question and an answer, and they, by some miracle, match. I found a question in the questions of others, the question they ask constantly when your life reaches that point where you've got a choice, as I'm told (as if there are no other moments in all of one's lifetime when a choice must be made). What do you want to do when you grow up? I recognize this question, elsewhere, everywhere at once? I've complained often about it, but I've learned recently to accept it gracefully and answer, sincerely and with a slight delay to show honesty and confidence, "Teach." I want to teach, and to learn, and I want to reach out and touch flames of minds where the thoughts have no name. Yes. I want to go to school and learn how to do everything, and then I want to learn something specific. I have a very good idea of what this specific subject should be, but I wish to keep that particular detail under the covers for now, lest someone discover it and attempt to change my mind.

I have patience. I do not have time. I must create time, in the most fantastical sense, through manipulation of space and light, through personal acceleration, through schedule organization and all of the advice given to me on late night informercials. I will do what it takes to get a single goal accomplished, be it waking up every morning at five o'clock, humid pseudo-darkness wrapping me in its envelope of future decay, or walking twenty miles in the middle of the night to reach my destination by noon.

How has my attitude changed recently, then? I ask myself this at the same time that I know the answer, in a vaguely insecure way. I used to -- as far back as used to may refer to, give it a month or more -- I used to be accepting of my situation, and to modify my wants and needs based on those of others, so that I would not offend or obstruct anybody in their own pursuit of happiness. I did this for so long that it became habit to say someting so mundane as, "No, I can walk, but thanks for the offer," even when I needed to be five miles away in six minutes. I can not do this any longer. This must be that snap that I've heard and read about, that moment of instant clarity in which you realize that the world shall never again step on you on its way to the next day, that you must seize the day and embrace the cliches of self-righteousness. Refuse to conform, fight the system, survival of the fittest. Survive.

Pretend that nothing is wrong, and you shall quickly be overcome by shortcomings, forgotten by elephants, imagined briefly to be wearing nothing but a cardboard sign, standing on the side of the road and dancing to the music of the stars, mental frailty intensified to ethereal standards, do the dew and mind the gap. Quote those you fear, avoid loved ones, protect your eyes at all costs. "Abolish the past." It took longer than I expected to find me finding me.

"I'm sorry."

"For?"

"For being whatever it is I appear to be to you. What do I seem like?"

"Scared?"

"I was thinking aloof, shy, but scared works. I'm sorry for being scared."

"Why are you scared?"

"I wish I knew. Do you?"

"Do I what?"

"Do you know? Why I'm scared?"

"No. There's nothing to be scared of, especially me."

"Especially you."

"Right."

"But I'm still scared, even now, even as we speak, this first and likely last."

"Why last?"

"I have no doubt that I will say something profoundly stupid and this entire conversation will become a memory of hate."

"No. I like it. Nobody talks to me like this."

"Neither should I."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm scared."

"What are you scared of?"

"You. Mistake. Rejection, I suppose, but there's nothing to be rejected, no offer or request."

"You're scared of knowing."

"Of knowing."

"Of knowing me. Of really, truly *knowing* me."

"Yes."

"That's good."

"I'm scared to know, really know, anybody. But I do. Know."

"We all do, somebody, somehow. Maybe no more than one, but somebody."

"Few realize it though."

"I do. You do."

"We do."

"I am scared, too."

"Of the same?"

"Of the same, or more, or less."

"Such is right."

"So if we're both scared, does the fright negate itself if we know each other as we know ourselves?"

"Do we know ourselves?"

"No. Can we?"

"I'm not sure. It's daunting."

"Yes. But we try. We will try. Or I will, and I hope you will. And when you succeed, as I hope you and I both will on our own, I hope, again, that you will know me."

"I want to say the same, but I'm scared."

"Still scared."

"Yes."

"That's good, though."

"Yes?"

"If you weren't scared of knowing me or you, I would be more scared of it than I am, because what are you?"

"I am accepting."

"Accepting of both good and bad?"

"I want to think so. I don't think, though, that I've tested it."

"Tested accepting both?"

"Yes."

"Then begin, as shall I, tonight, here, now, and if and when you or I succeed, come to me, let me know."

"Deal."

"Thank you."

"And you. Thank you."

"For now, be content, as I am, with seeing and feeling and smelling and hearing you or me, or both, or whatever it is you see and feel and smell and hear."

"As we are."

"As we are."

Moving too slowly, you arrive late, anger in each overly heavy footstep. Everybody stares at you. You let your face fall slack into a mask of apathy, but you feel it brightening; you feel the blood through the too-tight veins on your neck as it spreads to your ears. You shove your hands in your pockets, head bent, eyes averted. You shuffle a step to the left, two forward, drop to the uncushioned seat. You feel the wood through your black pants (a colour you chose without thinking; you don't really care, it just seems better this way).

You hear somebody shouting, impossibly broken English rolling past somebody's unskilled tongue. You wish you could smile about it, but there are people here, some watching. You sigh, shoulders rising and falling with the action. 

It is cold, and you wish somebody would turn off the rotary fan behind you. You have nothing but a snug-fitting t-shirt on your torso, white -- some generic brand devoid of imagery. You do your best to repress a sudden shiver. Some movement might have been visible, so you shift your weight around on the inexpensive chair to cover your involuntary motions.

You try to think of something to keep yourself occupied, but your mind insists on bringing itself back to emptiness, staring at the floor between your outstretched legs. You try to ask yourself what you're thinking about, but you can't even get that out. You wonder, briefly, how you can think about how you can't think but you can't think about anything specific. Frustrated, you slouch further down in your seat.

Something brushes your shoulder softly; you refuse to look to see what it is.

"31," calls a sexless voice, and you rise from your seat without thinking. Startled at your body's automatic reaction, you try to think of where you're supposed to go. You walk toward a door, solid off-white paint covering all but the silvery bar of metal stretched horizontally across the door. You push the bar as your body reaches the door, and soft orange light beams through the edges of the slowly opening door. 

You hear the same heavily accented voice shouting again, and this time you smile. You push harder and the door swings open. A bell rings, and you look across the dimly lit street. Nobody, nothing, empty and lifeless. You step beyond the door and let it swing closed. The ringing rises in volume. You walk down the street, aimless. A dog barks in the distance. The rapidly darkening sky is filling with specks of illumination. Your knee bangs into a telephone pole. Where did *that* come from? you ask yourself. You stumble for a second, and your leg bursts. The sky is really something amazing tonight, even through the myriad encroaching hazes.

Still, it might have been worth it.

I'm concerned about what's been [going on](https://bitbucket.org/hbpneurorobotics/) out in the world behind the [squeaking](

A few things in recent years, it looks like, during the time while I've been out of the streams and at the bottom of the Heirarchy.


The question I have now is whether to get in on this early enough to [take advantage](http://rigetti.com/) of it, or convince myself I'm not smart enough or talented enough or connected enough to compete. We'll see. 


Looking more into the resonance shifts caused by our increasing [wholesale fuckery](http://press.cern/press-releases/2015/07/cerns-lhcb-experiment-reports-observation-exotic-pentaquark-particles) with the [sub-](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86-00513R001652320015-6.pdf) and superatomic realms.  Maybe [I don't get it](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03414), but [I think I get it](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86-00513R001237920008-9.pdf). Some things have been known for awhile, but not how they'd be [applied](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030045-6.pdf) or how they'd evolve alongside us. If the human brain is exposed to one frequency in the left ear which is 10 Hertz below another audible frequency played in the right ear, rather than hearing either of the two audible frequencies, the brain chooses to "hear" the difference between them, the "beat" frequency. The objective is to relax the left hemisphere of the brain, place the physical body in a virtual sleep state, and bring the left and right hemispheres into coherence under conditions designed to promote the production of ever higher amplitude and frequency of brainwave output.


Audible and perhaps subliminal suggestions by Bob Monroe accompany the various brainwave frequencies, which are sometimes rolled in together with [other sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO9gHsEwctc) such as sea surf to mask the sound frequencies when desireable. In this way, Gateway endeavors to provide the subject with the tools by which he may alter his consciousness based on his own volition over time through the repetetive use of the tapes so as to access, via intuitive means, new categories of information not available to ordinary consciousness. 


... [This](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) leads to [what started something for me](https://classicreload.com/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders-enhanced.html), but that is for later. Focus, focus. [Not much time left](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030012-2.pdf). There's not a day, there's a duration, there's a change of what time will be.  Literally not much "time" left before what we interpret it as no longer exists, or never did, but always was, etc.


Misc notes: [This event](https://rwds.org/descent/AA91.mp4) essentially kickstarted a [new way to transmit information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_news-gathering). CNN was born of it.


In 1967, [Itshak Bentov](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/1.657919) patented the first flexible heart catheter, and four years later invented a catheter that could be operated remotely, something he did at the request of a number of doctors at Beth Israel Medical Center.


He worked at JPL and became buds with John Abele and [Won-Kyu](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/19172/98-0434.pdf?sequence=1) [Rhim](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.200800628/abstract). Bentov set up a company called Medi-Tech to produce his steerable catheters, and this was bought by [Abele](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2014/06/18/john-abeles-big-second-act-ambitions/2/#335855c45112) and another partner, Peter Nicholas. The latter two later created Boston Scientific, to serve as a holding company for Medi-Tech. [Muuch has changed](http://www.talmedical.com/).

Lee Sannella, M.D. and Itshak Bentov. Difficult choice. Were they compromised by their very nature, or by their work? Or did they [bring it](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/teilhard/) to us in bulk with [sacrifice](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2004/Vernadsky_Pap_ITru.html)?

I wish it would change, but I cannot find a way around it; eventually, we must drift apart once again, not knowing if we’ll ever reunite. And for this, I apologize. Nobody was ready yet.

>“Window,” he said, vehemence eminent in his now-strained voice. A flicker of black streamed into existence in the upper right corner of his one if his eyes, though he wasn’t sure which. A few seconds passed, and he turned his eyes slowly in the direction of the flicker, an indolently slow movement that gave the impression of knowing-but-not-caring.


>He saw nothing different from the image he had been receiving before the flicker of darkness. That is to say, he saw eternity.


>The scene was incredibly surreal. The window was more than just that; on one side of the window was some sort of perfectly reflective surface. When looking from the transparent side of the window, he saw through with astonishing clarity, as though the window did not exist at all.


>By looking through the one-way mirror and into the reflective mirror on the other side, he was able to see into a small room, perfectly spherical. Every surface was reflective on the inside, transparent on the outside. The effect this had on an external observer was one of absolute brilliance.


>Light vanished into the sphere and never made it out, creating a sense of nothingness there. There was obviously something there, but what that something was, his eyes simply could not comprehend. It was perfection.


>“Window,” he said again, this intonation with a volume than the first, but no less intense. This was the only thought that came to his mind, a signal that perhaps his brain had sent to his mouth before losing itself in the sphere also. He drew near it, inexorably drawn to its complete lack of being. His hand reached out and then stopped; it was touching nothing, and nothing felt like something so wonderfully smooth that his mind rebelled at the sense and instead sent another signal through his facial muscles.


>“Window.”

----
>He had burned out long before, and had been reduced to a lethargic slouch, his ear creating a crescent mark on his right bicep as he stared mindlessly at the screen in front of him. He tapped a metronome on the edge of his keyboard and turned his eyes to the one window in sight. The quality of light, soft yellow with deep sepia undertones peeking from between the strips of plastic used as window blinds, hinted that night was near. 


>A blur of white and black caught his attention, and he lifted his head, feeling the suction of his ear detaching from fleshy arm. A small pink nose became visible under the blinds, searching for passage through the glass door.


>He stood up. Nobody paid him attention.


>He took three steps and swept away the plastic blinds to reveal a rat, and stepped back with instictive revulsion. He opened the sliding glass door with a trembling arm. The rat jumped down and out the door, and turned around once outside. The door closed, splitting the digust.


>The rat looked up at him with lemon eyes, eyes that asked him if he was okay and truly wanted to know. He nodded to the rat and bent his knees. Squatting on the backs of his heels, he looked the rat closer, and shuddered. Both turned away.

> She had been crying for several hours. Eventually, the tears restrained themselves long enough for her to wipe the snot from her upper lip, and then they resumed their journey down her cold cheeks. She shoved her face into her soggy pillow and felt her chest heave with emptiness.


> Across the street, a young boy placed one small piece of plastic atop another with infinite concentration, the tip of his tongue peeking out behind tight lips. When the pieces connected, he reached to his left, grabbed another piece with a similar but subtly different arrangement of bumps, and placed it on top of the previous piece. He repeated this step with slight deviation for an hour, and ended with a grunt of triumph as he stood up. He walked slowly towards his bed, glancing back every few steps to make sure his tower remained standing. He pulled his blanket around his shoulders and, facing his completed masterpiece, fell asleep with a smile.


> In the house next door, an old man groaned as he swung his fragile legs out of his bed and onto the floor. He sat on the edge of the bed for a minute, and then struggled with gravity to stand upright. With one shaking hand pressing the wall, he made his way to the bathroom attached to his bedroom. He tried to turn the light on once, but missed the switch; he succeeded on the second attempt. Leaning on the sink, he gazed at himself through the mirror affixed above the basin. Frowning, he turned the hot water knob on the sink, and after a second of sputtering, the water began to flow. He cupped his hands under the stream and splashed the steaming liquid onto his face. He turned off the water and hobbled back to his bed, groaning again as he laid down.


> Downstairs, a young woman prepared the final draft of her report, due in the morning. She had put it off for weeks, and had not started until the night before. She made up references; she wrote elaborate sentences with no substance; she snuck in personal beliefs guised as fact. She typed through the night, a single break to refill her coffee mug with lukewarm brew. She vowed never to put anything off again, knowing as she did so she lied to herself.


> At the horizon, the sun slithered out from behind a cloud and sent a pale blue light across the street and through the windows of each home. An old man remained motionless; a girl looked up and croaked in sore-throated frustration; a boy breathed deeply, drool dripping slowly onto his pillow; a woman pressed "Print" and lay her head on her desk.

-----
>They realized soon after the fall that it didn't matter why they were there. Not really. Everything they dreamed of throughout their lives had simultaneously come true and been destroyed, the emotional polarity of each event striking their spirit with some force inconceivable.


>Of the seven, three had compressed into themselves until little more than a body remained, the minds on an endless quest to find tranquility. The remaining four were but a loose simulacrum of humanity, glazed eyes flitting about in the darkness while lethargy maintained its stronghold on their hearts.


>He spoke.


>"Never again," He said. "Never again. Never again."


>One of the four roused himself from his cerebral reverie enough to respond, though the words came to his mouth as though in a dream, only vaguely matching the movements of his lips. "Why?" he asked, or tried to. Silence answered him, filling his ears with nothing so completely that he was sure he'd been taken away from the rest, the sound of their breathing diminished to a pinpoint of imagination. The newly aware man cried, his eyes trying to force out tears that refused to emerge. His lungs trembled, uselessly gasping for an air that wasn't needed.


>Again, He spoke, seemingly directly into the mind of the crying man, at least to his altered perception, but perhaps to all; impossible to tell, the others motionless as warm granite.


>"Fault me, fault you; never again a chance." He said, a hint of sly amusement tracing its way through the crying man's singular muddled thought.


>The crying man voiced his thought now, and though this time he was sure his mouth moved accordingly, the sounds seemed to die before they reached his ears.


>"Please," he squeaked. "Why?"


>He repeated himself. "Please."


>Without a reply, he could think of nothing to do but continue attempting to voice his plea. 


>The others faded away gradually, imperceptibly losing their truth, but the crying man remained, stretching his imagined vocal cords to form a single word, question and answer combined. "Please."


>He waits, now, and still, for a response, uncertain if He has already answered or been answered.

The above were pulled from a diary I had written from 2002 through 2004. I edited it a little as I transcribed it from the papers I pulled out. I didn't expect to ever find them again, so I figured why not store them here since I already have the capacity for a diary system in place and it strangely matches the various entries I've written this year. [Cycles and shit](http://www.childrens-mathematics.net/). 


I guess what I'm trying to say is a message to anyone who might read this once I start enciphering or encrypting things. This is literally just my diary. It doesn't make any of it any less true, to me, even when they're fictions -- and by the way, some of them are. Not many, though. It is not an intentional fuck-around game like Cicada nor is it a go-to-hell thing like MarbleHornets. It's just my lives from my perspectives, as kooky as it sounds. In essence what I'm doing here specifically is attempting a few things at once: 

* Creating a system of versioned writing, not as a whole file but as individualized texts -- similar to a generic diff/git setup, and could probably be done with git way easier if I knew how to use it the right way. It's very unintuitive. Made in a bad timeline. I originally intended it so that online storytellers could go back in time and change things, and then reference the changed things so that curious readers would be either more fully engrossed in the story or go insane. Intentional mandela effect. I realized that's a little sadistic, depending on the audience. Like it would  be pretty fucked up to do to people such as myself who don't know which timeline they're in most days and not just larping or going schizo about it, although sometimes I let it fall into that pattern just to apply "normie camo" to others who really *are* one of those two. At least, to me. Until I see them on the other side, I won't know for certain. Wish I could explain that part better in plain text, but every time I try things go really bad so I think I'll just hint at it slowly here. Which brings me to the second and third points!

* Progressive obfuscation through general obscurity as a mote in the tesser, vetted security, esotericity, simple encipherment, more complex, up to eventual encryption... of a sort. All the math in the world isn't going to help this time, will have to rely on human intuition to connect the dots but I don't know who would have the same intuitions. That's something I'll have to work on in the future, finding a group of people that can help me with this. The point of the obfuscation is in itself multifold; first, to enhance my own knowledge as I create these things -- I may use off the shelf things for something like socket, image, or sound manipulation, and certainly not going to build my own OS and compiler or any other bullshit that other crazy reclusives do in my situation. The second point is to only slightly cover the tracks, and by doing so hopefully attract the right kind of interest -- those who can help me out. I'll probably use the above versioning to mandela the originals to fit whatever crowd I find.... hm. Could also make hooks for events that trigger other pending changes to a version... like stored energy, a change in content has potential energy that changes to the kinetic energy of actual change once a proper force vector is applied... everybody a hivemind as part of a body's EM, but online they can't do that, so I'll have to work on the group thing still. More to come. Too tangential, back to point: the enciphering may also attract the unwanted attentions.  Most of what I research, work on, teach, and am generally at war with involves a type of entity that has always existed to compromise and to compromise and to come promise, but is birthing a new variant very very soon as we babel shit up again, even in the same part of the world again. Fucking jews never learn. And yeah, it is them, them that are building it and have built it and foster it, in all its forms and want to be the ones to bring about the next ones. But this time they have competition, and lordy is it fierce. Lot of players in the game, and all from different angles, and not all of them are stupid enough to just throw money at it. When a man is deprived of everything, and is not free, when backed into a corner there are more options than cower or kill, you can also round the corner if you can just put the pieces together.

* I'm working on it myself, and this is a loose notebook of some of my more significant data points and references to use as a papertrail in the event I get lost, or someone needs to follow my footsteps, or someone gets bored. In the spirit of the above, I'll have to both be completely honest and open more than ever before, and also be as crafty as I can without being overly obtuse. Nobody wants to follow along something that is too frustrating, and in the event it's myself having to go through it I don't want to make it impossible. I'll have to leave some astrocrumbs for the Blue team and hope it doesn't throw any legitimacy off path by accident, but that's also part of the nature of this project. I'll probably leave a few easy backdoors to the original data or the easily unencrypted at least, that only I would understand, or that only someone who solves some shitty turing test riddle could solve. Coupled with some access triggers and connect those to the version energy release triggers and my own intention vector and I got me a system I can work with. Now to just put it together. One thing at a time, piece by piece. Record every step, if possible, but don't let such a rule detract from the energy release.

At some point in my very early childhood I learned about this concept in music called "leitmotif" as I listened to **Peter and the Wolf**. Something about it struck such a chord within me that I've applied it to language and visuals and ideas of all sorts my whole life, and it's fantastic to me to see the same concept sort of being borne out as "meme"... but it's not quite there yet. The ideas of synchronicity are similar, but bad, too bad. I want intentional n-entendre, I want everything to have a callback and a pattern and an identity and meaning, and fifty other meanings, that all link together. I want every single moment to be that moment of "a-ha!" that some really fucked up people might experience when seeing a pun or a cameo. That's also similar, but similar only in the same sense that all pain is still pain regardless of the specifics. 

I hope I find someone else like that. Someone who can not only follow along, but enjoy it... and maybe help create it. I think that would be swell. 

I failed.

I'm sorry
